# python-capture-model-tools
Python code to turn a pipe-delimited/csv of groups and fields into JSON that can be imported by the omeka capture model importer.

Initially for internal use by Digirati clients using the Annotation Studio to render annotation, transcription, tagging, and other crowd-sourcing capture models.

The Annotation Studio uses a single nested block of JSON-LD which defines the fields to be captured, and how those fields should be grouped and nested in the UI.

This block of JSON-LD is generated by quering the Omeka API for:
* Item Sets -- which correspond to Groups of fields.
* Items -- which correspond to individual Element fields.

This block of JSON-LD can be generated by Wilko (a standalone Flask service) or natively by the Annotation Studio model in Omeka.

This tool generates an importable version of the JSON-LD model that can be imported used the Capture Model Importer model, and which will generate the Omeka Item Sets and Items as required to provide the full capture model via Wilko or the Annotation Studio module.

 
# Changes since previous version

* Dropped use of templates for the Crowd Source Group and Crowd Source Elements. JSON generated directly from the Python object created for each CSV row.
* Use QNames [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QName] for the CSV column headers
* Automatically expand and contract QNames during JSON-LD generation.
* Use @context.json file for namespace lookup
* Default boolean and non-boolean values set automatically, to reduce the number of columns that need data entered.
* use of @id and QName pairs for linked data vocab (including Madoc vocab) throughout
* less verbose, cleaner Python code.
